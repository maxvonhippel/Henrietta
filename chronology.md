In this document, I intend to document the chronology of improvements I make to Henrietta over time.  This setup should eventually begin to look (in conjunction with the [wishlist](wishlist.md) document) a lot like a [SCRUM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) setup, in which taks move from "todo" (wishlist) to "done" (here), with documentation throughout.
